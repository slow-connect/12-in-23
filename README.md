# 12-in-23
 
I am participating in the #12in23 challenge from exercism.org, see [here](https://exercism.org/challenges/12in23) for more information. I do not know which languages I will make yet. 

For Python, check out [this link](https://exercism.org/tracks/python) and  for [Bash](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash). 

I have made the Hello World of Elixir, but I don't know yet if I want to conutinue doing it.
